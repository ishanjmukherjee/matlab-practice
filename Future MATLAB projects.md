# Future MATLAB projects

- A script to solve an augmented matrix.
- A script to generate augmented matrices that row-reduce nicely (ie, without long computations and messy fractions). Prof Ilya Mikhelson says he has already written such a program.
  - A possible way to do this is to start with a solved augmented matrix $[I|b]$ where the column vector $b$ only has integers between (say) -10 and 10. Then, perform a predetermined number $k$ of row operations. Use a random generator to determine whether to i) multiply a row by a constant, ii) exchange rows, or iii) add a multiple of one row to another. Then, again use random generator to find integers within a small range to use for these operations. (It'd be fun to see if you can generate nice matrices using just the third kind of row operation.)   
- A script to bet optimally in [Northwestern GEN_ENG 205-1](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/electrical-computer/academics/courses/descriptions/205-EA-1-1.html)'s third homework program.
- A script to convert a number (eg, 42) into its English equivalent (eg, "forty two").
