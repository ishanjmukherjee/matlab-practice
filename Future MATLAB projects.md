# Future MATLAB projects

- A script to solve an augmented matrix.
- A script to generate augmented matrices that row-reduce nicely (ie, without long computations and messy fractions). Prof Ilya Mikhelson says he has already written such a program.
- A script to bet optimally in [Northwestern GEN_ENG 205-1](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/electrical-computer/academics/courses/descriptions/205-EA-1-1.html)'s third homework program.
- A script to convert a number (eg, 42) into its English equivalent (eg, "forty two").
